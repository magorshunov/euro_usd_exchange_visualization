# Euro_USD_exchange_visualization
EURO-USD Exchange Rates During George Bush (2001-2009), Barack Obama (2009-2017), and Donald Trump (2017-2021)

This project develops a data visualization on Euro-USD exchange rates. I explore a dataset that describes daily exchange rates for the euro between 1999 and 2021. The dataset was prepared by Daria Chemkaeva using European Central Bank as a source and posted at Kaggle.com (kaggle.com/lsind18/euro-exchange-daily-rates-19992020). I focus on Euro-USD exchange rates during the presidency of three US presidents.
