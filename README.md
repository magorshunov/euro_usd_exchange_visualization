#EURO-USD Exchange Rates During George Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump
This notebook develops a data visualization of Euro-USD exchange rates. I explore a dataset that describes daily exchange rates for the euro between 1999 and 2021. The dataset was prepared by Daria Chemkaeva using European Central Bank as a source and posted at [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lsind18/euro-exchange-daily-rates-19992020). I focus on Euro-USD exchange rates during the presidency of three US presidents.

The development process is described in the Jupyter Notebook `notebook.ipynb`.The dataset is available under the file name `data.csv`.
